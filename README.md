Etch

Etch is an interactive instrument, not a sketchpad.

It treats input as commitment, movement as signal, and history as material.
There is no reset. What’s drawn is overwritten, not erased.

Etch remembers.

What this is

Etch explores the idea of infinite state through direct interaction.

There is no “start over.”

There is no undo.

The surface accumulates decisions over time.

Interaction isn’t about producing a perfect image — it’s about working with consequence.

How it behaves

A single control drives movement.

Small input changes matter.

Mistakes are absorbed, not rejected.

Repetition leaves traces.

Overwriting is intentional and correct.

The system doesn’t explain itself.
It shows you how it works by how it responds.

Why it exists

Most software hides history.
Most demos reset for effect.

Real systems don’t.

Etch is a way to make persistence, determinism, and consequence felt rather than described — the same qualities that matter in production systems, long-lived tools, and real work.

How to approach it

Don’t look for a goal.

Don’t look for a reset.

Spend a minute. Or ten.

Let the surface accumulate.

If you stop early, that’s fine.
If you stay longer, more reveals itself.

Notes

Etch is intentionally restrained.

There are no tutorials, no onboarding flows, and no hidden shortcuts.
Any complexity you encounter is part of the instrument, not an accident.
